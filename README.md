# Sonar Scalastyle Plugin

Wraps up Scalastyle as a SonarQube plugin. Currently scalastyle provides 60 different checks. They  
are represented as 38 rules without parameters and 22 templates in SonarQube. Templates allow to instantiate
the same check multiple times with different values. For example different regular expression rules with different
severity levels.
